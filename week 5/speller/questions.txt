Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

Because we dont need the copies changed we need the original values changed. This is like the issue seen in lecture #4.

Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

1) Main first checks that the user has given valid arguments and sets up the dictionary based on inputs or lack of inputs
2) The load function is called to put the dictionary in memory and this is timed
3) Files are opened (or error occurs if there is a problem). A char c is read, and the for loop continues to do this as long as c is not EOF
4) If the char is a letter or comma then it is added to the word array, and the length of the word is checked to be less than max
5) Once a word is found it is ran through the check function

Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

So we can test one char at a time for better efficiency

Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

So that they are secure and cannot be changed
