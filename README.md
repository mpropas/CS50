# CS50X

This repo contains all the work I did for Stanford / Yale / Edx Course that I completed in February of 2017. A summary of this work is
listed below:

Week 0:
  A simple asteroids game built on MITs scratch platform.
  
Week 1:
  An introduction to C. The most interesting problem is called 'Credit', in which we write a program which verifies a credit card to be
  VISA, Mastercard, or AMEX by implementing Luhn's algorithm.
  
Week 2:
  The focus of this week was encryption. The problem set features Caesar's and Vigenere's Ciphers in C.
  
Week 3:
  This week featured data structures looking at common searching and sorting algorithms. The homework included building a C based version
  of the classic game Fifteen.
  
Week 4:
  Pointers and memory management. This week we learned how a lower level language such as C gives the programmer the ability to allocate
  memory to the heap and the stack, and how this ability can result in memory leaks if done incorrectly. In the homework we studied how
  BMP and JPG files are defined by microsoft, and used C to manipulate them directly. Firstly, in 'Whodunit' we study the RGB color
  characteristics of each pixel, ultimately altering the image to decode a secret message. In 'Resize', we implement a similar progrom to
  resize a BMP image by a factor of 'n', and in 'Recover' we build yet another C program that scans a theoretical hard drive and recovers
  lost JPGs.
  
Week 5:
  More focus on data structures, and instruction on how pointers and structs can be utilized to construct link lists, an answer to the
  inherent limitations of using simple arrays in C. In the homework we constructed a program to scan a dictionary file and then spell
  check a piece of literature for mistakes. My strategy was the build an alphabetical hash table.
  
Week 6:
  HTML and CSS and some background on the internet. No homework, material is all review for me.
  
Week 7:
  No homework this week. In this lecture we transitioned from C to Python and saw how machine learning algorithms can be setup with minimal
  code in python with the help of libraries such as Numpy etc. The limitations of these models was also discussed including the recent 
  example of one of Tesla's self driving cars crashing.
  
Week 8:
  More on python. For the problem set we ported some of our programs written in C to Python, and then built a program called 'Sentiments',
  which uses twitters API to take in a twitter handle as input and then retreives the users tweets, analyzes them to be either
  positive or negative based on the wording, and then creates a pie chart representing the general sentiments of that user.
  
Week 9:
  This week introduces databased, particularly relational databases in SQL. The lecture covered why databases are so useful and how
  they can be vulnerable to malicious injections if not designed properly. For homework we used Pythons Flask framework and SQLite to
  build a stock trading website where users can register, login, logout, see their portfolio, buy stocks, and sell stocks.
  This involved a log of form validation, SQL table setup, and some basic HTML page writing.
  
Week 10:
  The final language introduced for CS50X was javascript. This lecture showed JQuery, javascript events, and AJAX. The problem set
  had us create a 'Mashup' website which used Python's Flask framework as a backend to get data from a SQL database as well as google's
  news API to create a web application where the user can search the US via google maps by postal code, city, or state and receive
  local and recent news articles for that location. It also implements Twitter's typahead plugin to give location suggestions to
  the user.
