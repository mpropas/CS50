1.  What is <stdint.h> ?
<stdint.h> is a library that allows the programmer to explicitly state the size of the integers that are being used.
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
It states the memory size differences in the different kind of variables used in the program.
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
1, 4, 4, 2
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify
file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
"BM"
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, which includes the headerfiles, while biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER
header file.
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
If biHeight is negative, indicating a top-down DIB, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS. Top-down DIBs
cannot be compressed.
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
If the user does not give a valid file name
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because there is just one element
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
3
11. What does fseek do?
sets the file position of the stream to the given offset.
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
Current position of the file pointer
